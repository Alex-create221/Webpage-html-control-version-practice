# Webpage-html-control-version-practice
in this page I will add all I have learned from udemy´s course and coddy to make html documents


# ver 1.0 

In this case I have added the tags:  
-(blockqoute) 
this tag is used to make large quotation in text blocks and it is not used inside paragraphs because it has its own content, it can destroy the flow of the text.
-(q)
is used to quote inline words, you can use it to quote phrases inside pragraphs without creating other paragraphs and destroying the flow of the text.
-(abbr)
is used to make abbreviation of acronyms, like MDN (moxila developer network) 
-(bdo) 
is used to change the direction text using the atribute dir and the values rtl and ltr. It is used for other languages to write in the correct order 
-(head)
is used to give information about the html document, like: scripts, favicons, and other metadata information
-(link)
is used to connect favicons or CSS styles in the head tag. 

I also added these atributes:

# for link tag
-rel:  this atribute is used to referece the linked file with the current document
-type indicate the format of the linked file using the MIME  standard, type/subtype

-sizes it can change the size of the image, is useful when you want to desing a responsive favicon on your web page

-href it can use the URL of the linked file

# for q and blockqoute tags

-cite  , it is used for linking the URL of the external web you have quotated 

# for abbr tag

-title  , it is used for many tags, in this case is used for abbr tag to define the abbreviation of a word.

# for bdo tag 

-dir  it is used to change the text direction acording to these values: rtl (indicates from right to left) or ltr (indicates from left to right) it is used for other languages that are written like arabic.
