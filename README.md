# HTML Head and Text Formatting Practice 

This version is a learning excersice focused on understanding how HTML can
support document metadata and semantic text formatting.

## Concepts I have practiced

This practice has the following HTML concepts:

- Proper use of the '<head>' element
- Defining a descriptive '<title>'
- Linking external resources using '<link>'
- Use of favicons with different formats and sizes for other browsers
- Semantic text tags for quotations, abbreviations, text directions, paragraphs, header and main

  ## HTML tag used

  Are the following:

  - '<head>': Contains metadata such as the document title and external resources
  - '<title>': Defines the name shown in the browser tab
  - '<link>': Used to link favicon files
  - '<blockquote>': Represents a long quotation taken from an external source or webpage. It doesn´t display the quoted text (it has to be added by CSS)
  - '<q>': Define a short inline quotation inside a paragraph. It can display the quoted text by default
  - '<abbr>': Define the abbreviation and it allows the user its full meaning using the 'title' atribute. Generally used for acronyms
  - '<bdo>': Overrides the text direction using the 'dir' atribute and the values 'rtl' and 'ltr'. Generally used for foreing languages like arabic and Hebrew

## What I have learned 

While I was building this web page, I have learned these concepts:

- Favicons must be inside of '<head>' tag, some linked resources need to be added according to MIME type standard to have a well done described resources like image/png  need to be added for files with .png
- Some types are not generally used like Apple touch
- '<blockquotes>' define long independent quotations used apart from other paragraphs, while '<q>' define short inline quotes used inside other paragraphs, in this tag do not break the text flow and display the quotated tex by default
- The '<abbr>' define semantic meaning, accesibility and better CEO position
-  HTML is responsible for structure giving the webpage a skeleton to put all the content
-  Using semantic tags is better than using div tag for meaning semantic text.
