# HTML fundamentals

## Inline vs Block elements

Inline: These are elements who are responsible of contain information inside blocks
like links (<a>) , images, or some text formating (<strong>) or (<em>),
These elements can be placed next to other inline elements, these containers will not 
take the 100% width of the web page, tehy will only take up as much width as necessary.
The inline elements do not start on a new line

Block: These elements take the 100% width of the webpage, they also start in a new line.
These elements can be placed vertically, and they are usually used to make structures
in the web page like headings, paragraphs, main information and more.
They are the blocks that can be placed inside of them many inline elements.

## Div  vs span

div: Div is a block element that is used for not semantic meaning, like empty containers
that can place many tags without semantic meaning the can be used for JS interactivity,
CSS style, or for other reasons

span: Span is a inline element that can also be used for not semantic meaning, 
like a small empty container for small prhases inside blocks, used to create
JS interactivity, CSS style, or to containg information 

## Entities

HTML entities are special code to display normal symbols, entities used to display characters that can be confused for HTML or 
to render some other symbols in many web browsers. HTML can confuse some symbols like
"<", ">", "/", etc assuming it is code and displaying nothing in the web page, it 
can also be used for displaying some symbols using the special code 


## Mistake 

The mistake I usually made, Was using div all the time, now I know that is not
necessary using the div tag, because It is only used for not semantic meaning, 
not for containing anything or group tags.
